# C172-weightandbalance

This is a simple calculator to find the weight and balance of a Cessna 172, written in python. 
It is always advised to check with your specific manual on the weight and balance of your specific plane, 
but this should at least give a good idea of where your moment, CG, and weight is for your flight.

Basic weight and moments are needed for your own plane and flight to make full calculations.
